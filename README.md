# dijkstra
A variation of Dijkstra's algorithm written using Python; priority queue implemented with the heapq module.

This project is one I really enjoyed. It is a very classic interpretation of the famed Dijkstra's Algorithm, and I like to think it showcases not only my ability to write logic-based code, but also my ability to overcome roadblocks preventing me from furthering my skillset (I was never very good at writing algorithms like this until now, since I forced myself to take on this project).
If I'm being honest, this project is one of my favorites simply because it was fun. I'm not finished with it yet, my next step is to visualize it!
